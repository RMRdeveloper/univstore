## 🏗️ Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main projects:

1. **[`api/`](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/tienda/api)**: The "brain" of the operation. A NestJS RESTful API that handles data persistence, authentication, and business logic.
2. **[`webapp/`](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/tienda/webapp)**: The user interface. A modern Next.js application that provides a fast and interactive UX.

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of UnivStore is to demonstrate a clean, scalable, and maintainable full-stack architecture using modern web technologies and best practices like SOLID principles and containerization.
